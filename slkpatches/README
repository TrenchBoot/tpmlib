Secure Launch Early TPM Extend Patches

The original design of Secure Boot used a minimal TPM driver built into the
compressed kernel. This was not an acceptable approach for approval in the
upstream Linux kernel. The solution used there was to postpone extending the
TPM PCRs until after the mainline kernel TPM driver was avalable during the
late init phase of booting. This was a less than ideal compromise but there
was no other way that could be found to satisfy their requests.

This patch set will restore the early compressed kernel TPM driver and allow
the PCR extends to happen very early in the boot before the mainline kernel is
extracted and run.

Current version base on:

5.13-rc6 with Secure Launch patches from the LKML v2 posting
